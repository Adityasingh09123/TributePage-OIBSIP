              <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
              <p>
                <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> 15 October 1931 - 27
                July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the
                11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and
                raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and
                aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a
                scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence
                Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space
                Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in
                India's civilian space programme and military missile
                development efforts. He thus came to be known as the Missile Man
                of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile
                and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal
                organisational, technical, and political role in India's
                Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original
                nuclear test by India in 1974.
